### Post answers (and links to where you found them) for each of the questions below:

1. Can we use `npm` with React or do we have to use `yarn`?
  You can use both, but Yarn is suggested for those new to package managers

2. We are using JSX to write HTML inside of our React. Are we required to use JSX with React? Are there any alternatives?
  You are required to use JSX because it is what translates HTML to JS within the Virtual DOM

3. Does React re-render the entire component when one part of it changes?
  No. It just refreshes the parts that have changed

4. Should we ever change `props` (or parameters) inside of a component? 
  No because all React components and props must act like pure functions

  No sometimes they are states

6. List five "Synthetic Events" provided by React:
  Clipboard events, composition events, touch events, media events, animation events

7. Do we have to use ES6 syntax with React?
