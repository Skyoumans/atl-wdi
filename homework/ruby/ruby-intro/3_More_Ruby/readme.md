# HW Reading: Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby

[POODR](http://www.poodr.com/) (pronounced "pooder") explains object-oriented design (OOD) in Ruby. Javascript is an object-oriented language but it is not class-based like it is in Ruby, Java, C++, C, etc.. POODR was written by Sandi Metz, a software developer and author focused on writing flexible object-oriented code in Ruby and Rails.

## Exercise Objectives

- have fun reading material on programmatic thinking and design
- gain insight to programming languages from a design standpoint
- gain an intermediate level of understanding Ruby as a class-based language
- start thinking about the differences in Javascript and Ruby

## Directions

Read the first 3 chapters of POODR [available as a PDF here](https://github.com/edenzik/cs105b/blob/master/books/Practical%20Object-Oriented%20Design%20in%20Ruby.pdf) and answer the questions below.


### Short Answer Questions:

Answer should be no more than a couple of sentences. Refer to the reading.

1. According to Metz, what is Object-oriented design about?

```
The process of planning a system of interacting objects for the purpose of solving a software problem. It is one approach to software design.
```

2. What does SOLID stand for?

```
Single Responsibility
Open/closed
Liskov substitution
Interface segregation
Dependency inversion
```

3. Ruby is a class-based object-oriented language. What does that mean?

```
Ruby is a pure object-oriented language and everything appears to Ruby as an object. Every value in Ruby is an object, even the most primitive things: strings, numbers and even true and false. Even a class itself is an object that is an instance of the Class class.```

4. Where are methods defined in Ruby?

5. Why does single Responsibility matter?

```
if you use the words "and" or "or," you're most likely breaking the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). If you use the word "and," your class has at least two responsibilities.```

6. What does `attr_reader` do?

7. What are 4 benefits Metz outlines for methods that have a single responsibility?

```
Open/closed
Liskov substitution
Interface segregation
Dependency inversion```

8. What are 4 things an object knows when it has a dependency?
